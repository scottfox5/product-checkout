# Simple Product Checkout

This is a single page react application for a simple product checkout. The user selects an item from a catalog, then is brought to the next view where they fill out a form with shipping information. The total cost is dynamically updated based on state selected from dropdown. All fields must be filled out to submit order, and upon submission, user is brought to thank you page.
